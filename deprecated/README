Hurwitz package currently requires 
	-subversion client installation
	-Macaulay2 installation >=1.4
	

Usage: see EXAMPLE file.

For debugging I recommend to
- increase  the Infolevel : SetInfoLevel(InfoWarning,2);




	
TODO:
	-check presence of required programs.
	-connect routines to top-level of package "FR".
	-sometimes when calling from GAP it seems that the memory of M2 is corrupted (log function of M2 gives wrong answers. very strange...). Debug!
	
		


-It is currently not possible to host the Macaulay2 packages in the CVS,
because they are used at two places (in Macaulay2 and in GAP), 
but linking an external CVS is not possible because even for read permission (?) a user and a password are required.

It would help, if GAP will switch to mercurial or to SVN.
