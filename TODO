# link to libflint is not found (partly fixed by a hack) there is no correct fix for al cases yet
# flint is only found, in case it is configured as 'extern' and resides in the default directory

# gmp is probably not found, if it is installed but not compiled by GAP?
# what means --with-gmp=gap? should it use the GAP-Settings for gap? 
Currently for configure option '--with-gmp=gap' hmac only looks for gmp in $GAPDIR/bin/$TARGET/extern/gmp.

# currently 'hurwitzMapSearch' is only correctly compiled in case libraries installed  in the default system folders 
# or downloaded and compiled as extern (e.g. with-mpfr=extern)
# - how should it be done?

finite field search 
- is there still a bug for some greater (>100) characteristic...?
- add make target 'check' !
- compute not only the search space size (it is the upper bound), but the more realistic value 
(which slightly underestimates the real performed experiments)
- to attack harder problems separate the search by  
   -- the multiplicity combinatorics?

# AdditiveInverse not working  for RationalFunction? (problem in fr-package?)

 numthread parameter for c++ program.

-finish cleanup

- improve the data format for the returned records  - introduce objects?

- create object datatypes 'Power' ,  'Product' , 'Shape'?
- 'Power' object should have properties 'Base' and 'Exponent'
- 'Product' should have property 'Factors'


- setup different Info loggers and their output target
