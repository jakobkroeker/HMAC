Since GAP 4.5 users can configure the way help sections are displayed
in text mode (in the terminal running GAP) or in HTML mode (in a web browser).

In a running GAP session the setting can be changed with the commands
  SetGAPDocTextTheme,  resp.
  SetGAPDocHTMLStyle

See the help pages for these commands for more details.

For example, the commands
  SetGAPDocTextTheme("none");
or
  SetGAPDocTextTheme("old");
would cause that no colors are used to markup the text version of the help
sections.

(If only a specific color disturbs you, there is also the possibility to change
just that.)

If you want to use one of the above options in all GAP sessions by default
you can specify that in your 'gap.ini' file, add a line like

  SetUserPreference( "gapdoc", "TextTheme", [ "none" ] );

Users of the HTML help may want to use something like
  SetUserPreference( "gapdoc", "HTMLStyle", [ "default", "ragged" ] );
and/or
  SetUserPreference( "gapdoc", "UseMathJax", true );

If you do not yet use a gap.ini file, see the help section of
'WriteGapIniFile' to learn how to create one.
