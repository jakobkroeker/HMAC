This is the README file for the GAP package 'HMAC'.



Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HMAC package implements algorithmic construction of Hurwitz map approximations
using an algebraic approach.
The package also supports p-adic lifting of smooth isolated solutions of a polynomial system
over prime fields.

Authors: Jakob Kroeker and Laurent Bartholdi


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the package you have to install (or download and build)

- a C++ compiler (e.g. GCC)
- (GNU) Make
- a bash shell 

-the GAP computer algebra system, release 4.5.6 or later:
 http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html 

You may also install GAP as part of 'sagemath' (http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)

Then following  forked GAP packages are required:
-'FLOAT' ( https://github.com/jakobkroeker/float.git )
-'FR' (  https://github.com/jakobkroeker/fr.git )
- and the package 'HMAC' 

If they are not available, please download them to $GAP_ROOT/pkg/
and install as described below.

To build the 'FLOAT' package, change to $GAP_ROOT/pkg/float and run
./configure 
 make

If configure complains about missing packages, please install them first using the operating system 
package manager e.g. yum or aptitude

FR depends on GAP packages 'Alnuth', 'autpgrp', 'polycyclic' and 'FGA'
Again, if they not available (see $GAP_ROOT/pkg/), they can be downloaded  from 
http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/ and simply extracted in the $GAP_ROOT/pkg/ folder.


To build the 'FR' package, ensure that the dependencies above are installed, then 
change to $GAP_ROOT/pkg/fr and run './configure && make'.


If  building 'FR' or 'FLOAT' fails on your system, please report the observed issues.


The HMAC package is then built by running
  cd $GAP_ROOT/pkg/HMAC 
  ./configure 
  make


If the build processs fails due to a missing package, please install them on your system and retry; 
see also './configure --help' for options on that.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   See examples in the 'example'-folder 
   or consult the documentation ( 'manual.pdf' or 'index.html' ) in the 'doc'-folder.
