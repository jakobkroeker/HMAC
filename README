This is the README file for the GAP package 'HMAC'.



Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HMAC package implements algorithmic construction of Hurwitz map approximations
using an algebraic approach.
The package also supports p-adic lifting of smooth isolated solutions of a polynomial system
over prime fields.

Authors: Jakob Kroeker and Laurent Bartholdi


Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the package you have to install (or download and build)

- a C++ compiler (e.g. GCC)
- (GNU) Make
- Bash shell 

-the GAP computer algebra system, release 4.5.6 or later:
 http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html 

the GAP packages 
-'FLOAT' ( https://github.com/laurentbartholdi/float.git )
-'FR' (  https://github.com/laurentbartholdi/fr )
- and the package 'HMAC' itself

If  building 'FR' or 'FLOAT' fails on your system, please report the observed issues.

You may also try alternatively FLOAT and FR from 
 https://github.com/jakobkroeker/float.git
 https://github.com/jakobkroeker/fr.git


The HMAC package is built by running
  ./configure 
and 
  make


If the build processs fails due to a missing package, please install them on your system and retry; 
see also './configure --help' for options on that.
